# Deploy SOMOD Module

---

SOMOD prepare command creates deployable AWS SAM Project and NextJs Project.

```
npx somod prepare
```

- AWS SAM Project

  For the SAM Project, SOMOD creates the `template.yaml` file and the `.somod/` directory at the root of the module.

  The [AWS SAM Deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-deploying.html) guide explains the steps for AWS SAM Project deployment.

- NextJs Project

  For the NextJs Project, SOMOD creates the `pages/`, `public/` directories, `.env`, and `next.config.js` files at the root of the module.

  The [NextJs Deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) guide explains the different options for deploying the NextJs project.
