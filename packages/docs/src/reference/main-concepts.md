# Main Concepts of **SOMOD**

---

SOMOD makes it easy to **Develop**, **Build**, **Reuse** and **Deploy** Serverless Applications

In this guide, we will examine the concepts used in SOMOD projects. Once you master them, you can create complex applications from smaller reusable modules.

This reference is a step-by-step guide to explaining the main concepts of SOMOD. You can find the list of all concepts in the left navigation bar under [Reference](/reference)/[Main Concepts](/reference/main-concepts).

> This guide is designed for people who prefer learning concepts **step by step**.  
> If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide.
> You might find this and getting started guide complementary to each other.

## Assumptions

SOMOD is a **serverless** framework developed using `typescript` and `npm` packaging, so we will assume you have a basic understanding of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), and [Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/).

## Let's Get Started!

Let's start by understanding the building block of SOMOD, the [Module](/reference/main-concepts/module).
